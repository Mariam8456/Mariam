<p>My achievement was that I won a medal in annual inter schools speech and debates competition. I won first prize in class 5th.
I am also an avid reader and good writer. My second extracurricular achievement was that I won a cash prize of 10,000 rupees on a essay writing competition. I won with my essay on “Save trees Save Earth” during inter schools essay writing competition. I was in 7th grade at that time.
I have great interest in sports. I can play cricket very well. It was my biggest sports achievement that I helped my team win the tournament this year, in class 10th. I was awarded man of the match. It is a moment of pride and my greatest extracurricular success.</p>

<p>Also, i think self discovery is also part of my achievement in life, because once you discover yourself and accept what you are, then you can fulfil your potential and be happy.

The greatest achievement of the human spirit is to live up to one's opportunities and make the most of one's resources. I would say my greatest achievement in life right now, my greatest achievement period is, and i'm still trying to achieve it, is to be a wonderful father to my kids.</p>
